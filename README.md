# PowerShield
Fast Windows OS Security Patches

The aim for this project is to make a powershell script that can be downloaded from github and run to quickly patch things like smbv1, make changes to rdp security, automatically change and rotate passwords, and other cool stuff to help out blue team. I will start writing this in late May 2021.

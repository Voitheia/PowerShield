#TODO

+-- organized in priority of what should be done first and won't be too hard --+

automatic password changing of all users

disabling SMBv1 - registry keys and powershell one liners

RDP security through registry keys

mimikatz defence through registry keys

disabling of unnecessary services

downloading a few sysinternals tools, namely autoruns, tcpview, psexp and procmon

configure powershell execution policy

restart the box

+-- this stuff isn't as high a priority, and is probably harder to do than the stuff above --+

operating system detection if some powershell cmdlets work or don't on specific OSs

DC detection, script performs different actions if run on a DC

automatic password rotation?
  I don't think we want the script running all the time as to keep red team from taking advantage of it

maybe some detection of common services that are running on the computer

interactive firewall configuration. user tells script what ports are needed and script configures the rest

enabling of logs, application of event viewer filters if possible so logs are usable

maybe downloading and applying of critical security updates

relocating cmd and powershell or modifying them to make using them difficult
